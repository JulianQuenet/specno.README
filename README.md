# SPECNO ASSESSMENT

<h1 align="center">Choices and reasonings</h1>

## Register page

- I went a little away from the design in the figma file in terms of the layout with going from register ->log in I went with a tab bar view,
there's no specific reasoning I just liked the look of it. 
- I also added in the confirm password field as it just felt right to have it included, though other than these two things
I tried to stay as close as possible to the deisgn.
  
## Homepage/landing page
- I didn't deviate too much from the design though I did change the colour of the icons in the drop down of the card to 
match the colour of the offices, thought that would be a neat touch 

## Office view
- This design is also pretty close to the figma design, only difference being the add staff button, wasn't too sure where to put it 
so added it to the top right.
- Another addition is the "show all" button underneath the search bar just to reset the results after a search but the button is only 
shown after a search is performed
  
## Edit & add office 
- These two are also pretty close to the designs, I struggled a bit though with the radio buttons but I kind of did some trickery
the colours do update/changes according to the choice made but the radio buttons are actually covered in a container that has a background image that has the colour cirlces in it, and the radio buttons are just positioned in the center of them, I did the same for the avatar of the staff members.

## Profile
- Also pretty close to the design, I wasn't sure to what extent we should edit the user profile so I just added the option to change the avatar.

<h2 align="center">Short falls</h2>

## Thoughts
- There were a few areas that I wasn't happy with in terms of the outcome, first shortfall I faced was the picking of the colours and the avatars, wish I could've found a better option at least.
- The second was with the staff, I made a custom data type so that each office can have their own staff members but the problem I faced was with the update of the staff, since it's in a list with in a document I struggled to update the individual members, funny enough though I could delete them but unfortunately I couldn't find a solution to actually update them so I just had to delete and add when the user "updates" the staff member though I think I could've made a custom function to handle it but unfortunately I ran out of time.
- Last shortfall I faced was getting the social logins done, unfortunately I also ran out of time for that one as well.

# Overall feelings
- Not too happy with how it ended up, I wish I could've done more but I think if I did it a second time round it would've gone a lot better, majority of the time was spent learning but at the end that is a good thing, learning is never bad though nonetheless thank you for the opportunity, it was fun and I actually liked the puzzle solving aspect of it I guess I could say or at least at the beginning it was definetely a puzzle for me.
