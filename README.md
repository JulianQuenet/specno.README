# SPECNO ASSESSMENT

<h1 align="center">Choices and reasonings</h1>

## Register page

- I went a little away from the design in the figma file in terms of the layout with going from register ->log in I went with a tab bar view,
there's no specific reasoning I just liked the look of it. 
- I also added in the confirm password field as it just felt right to have it included, though other than these two things
I tried to stay as close as possible to the deisgn as possible
<br>
## Homepage/landing page
- I didn't deviate too much from the design though I did change the colour of the icons in the drop down of the card to 
match the colour of the offices, thought that would be a neat touch 
<br>
## Office view
- This design is also pretty close to the figma design, only difference being the add staff button, wasn't too sure where to put it 
so added it to the top right.
- Another addition is the "show all" button underneath the search bar just to reset the results after a search but the button is only 
shown after a search is performed
<br>
## Edit & add office 
- These two are also pretty close to the designs, I struggled a bit though with the radio buttons but I kind of did some trickery
the colours to update/changes according to the choice made but the radio buttons are actually covered in a container that has a background image that has the colour cirlces in it, and the radio buttons are just positioned in the center of them, I did the same for the avatar of the staff members.

## Profile
- Also pretty close to the design, I wasn't sure to what extent we should edit the user profile so I just added the option to change the avatar.
